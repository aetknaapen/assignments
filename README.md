# assignments

The right version of our assignment is python_assignment_final.
We made our assignment with Google Colaboratory. Therefore, by clicking on a link, it send you to a cell in the Google Colaboratory file.
We also have to admit that one code, the one with the graph of "bokeh", does not load in Github.
However, when clicking on the "open in Colab", above the assignment, this graph can also be seen.

With kinds regards,
